<p>
I like reading cold-war era anti-communist propaganda because it's absolutely absurd. Almost always it is an utterly breathless indictment of those godless commies who are evilly infiltrating society in a very, very organized manner that doesn't instantly split into a million little infighting factions.
</p>

<p>
What's fascinating though to me is how it envisions communists, and how the lines

<p>
One of the more ironic features of the comic is it's conflation, intentional or not, of communism and fascism.

What's notable
</p>

<p>
This is kind of an odd position if you think about it. First the position is that communism is evil, but secondarily.
</p>

<p>
To reach this conclusion presumably the authors

<p>
This seems to have extended to today, with a popular notion in the republican party being that

<h2 id="orga890eca">Communism Alone</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga890eca">
<p>
What particularly fascinates me about the comic is the notion that communism, at least as envisioned by the author, is alone. There are, of course, dastardly communists out there, but the dastardly communists are alone and separated from the rest of society. Their entire success is broken down to the conspiratorial motions of a few individuals.
</p>

<p>
There is not even an attempt to argue that the communists are developing a false consciousness <label class="sidenote-number" for="1"><sup>1</sup></label><input checked="checked" id="1" style="display: none" type="checkbox" /><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number"> 1</span> The notion that a group of people might develop goals contrary to their own interests.</span> of sorts, but rather a complete denial that the communists could in fact be popular. Everything is done out of pure evil desire to make people suffer, and not particularly a desire to enrich themselves.
</p>

<p>
In doing so it seems to avoid any real questions of why people might do these things, and therefore in a sense avoids any real.
</p>

<p>
However, this position is a very safe position, both for the reader and for the author. If they tried to give the enemy comprehensible motivations then they would have to hope that their own counter-arguments would suffice. Secondly, they would have to understand that it's not alien monsters who create what they consider terrible, but rather people just the same as they are.
